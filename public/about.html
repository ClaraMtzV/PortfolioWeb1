<h1>About Me</h1>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a proud Mexican Immigrant working towards freelancing so I can spend time with my son while I make money. I have been learing 
  programming since I was 15 years old. I grew up not knowing what computers were and what they did, until I took a course in High School 
  in Mexico. That's when I decided that I wanted to be a software developer. I took more programming courses in the US, and I went straight
  to finishing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a 3.45 gpa.

  I remember my first programming assignment was writing down coordinates to draw the alphabet
  on a turtle app. I loved the fact that I could create something that didn't exist by just typing. 
  Eventhough I have been through rough times while programming, I doubt there's something out there that gives me more satisfaction
  than seeing my program compile and run.

  I also love cooking and baking. I wanted to be a chef before I discover the power of computers. I love watching
  cooking shows because I learn a lot! I would say that I could eat anything thrown at me ONLY if it doesn't have crazy texture, and 
  it doesn't look scary.
